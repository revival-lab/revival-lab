## Science 

### Molecular Simulation

[Faunus](https://github.com/mlund/faunus) is a scientific software written in modern C++/Python for simulating
molecular systems at multiple length and time scales.
Over two decades we have kept up with the C++ standard and is now at C++17.

**Contribution:** Creator and development lead.

### Ancient Plotting

[Xmgr](https://github.com/mlund/xmgr-resurrection) is an ancient but still popular GUI tool
for plotting scientific data. It was utterly abandoned until we resurrected the code base.

**Contribution:** CMake build system; bug fixes; and support for 64-bit systems; Macports recipe.

### Hardware Remote Control via HTTP and Serial Communications

[Ultimate64](https://github.com/mlund/ultimate64) is a CLI for communicating with Ultimate 64/II+ hardware via HTTP requests.
[Matrix65](https://github.com/mlund/matrix) is a modern text user-interface
([TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface))
for serial communication with the MEGA65 computer.
Both tools are written in Rust <i class="fab fa-rust"></i>.
